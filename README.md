custom_agent = Agent(
    role="Custom Role",
    goal="Custom goal description",
    backstory="Agent background story",
    tools=[SerperDevTool()],
    llm=llm,
    verbose=False
)
```

### Creating Custom Tasks

```python
custom_task = Task(
    description="Task description with {input_variables}",
    expected_output="Description of expected output",
    agent=custom_agent,
    output_pydantic=CustomModel,
    output_file="output.json"
)
```

## üß™ Testing

The project includes comprehensive examples demonstrating:

1. **Single Meal Planning**: Basic recipe research and planning
2. **Two-Agent Shopping**: Meal planning with organized shopping lists
3. **Complete System**: Full meal planning with all agents and features

Run the examples to test different system components:

```python
# Test single meal planning
meal_planner_result = meal_planner_crew.kickoff(inputs)

# Test shopping organization
shopping_result = two_agent_grocery_crew.kickoff(inputs)

# Test complete system
complete_result = complete_grocery_crew.kickoff(inputs)
```
